# K Nearest Neighbors

this model looks for the nearest neighbors the number of neighbors denoted by n and find the trend between nearest neighbors and then gives a prediction

# Additional Notes

Saving this model is useless because even if we saved the model the algorithm still looks for every single data point and make the prediction.
